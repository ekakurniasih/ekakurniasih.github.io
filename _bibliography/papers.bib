   abstract = {Blue swimming crabs are one of the economically significant fisheries resources in Indonesia. However, Indonesia's blue swimming crab fisheries still depend on wild catches that lead to a non-target species harvest, especially the cryptic swimming crabs. This study aims to investigate the genetic diversity of blue swimming crab specimens and other cryptic species using a molecular approach (DNA Barcoding). The samples were caught from the waters of Tuban District, East Java, Indonesia, using traditional foldable traps or "bubu lipat". This study utilized the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method targeting the Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I (COI) gene. The sequences were then compared to the NCBI database to get the closest species based on the sequences. 21 out of 23 samples were identified as Portunus pelagicus, and two samples were identified as Charybdis feriata with percentage of similarity ranging from 99.68% to 100%. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using Neighbor Joining and Maximum Likelihood method with sequences from Scylla serrata as an outgroup. The genetic distance between P. pelagicus and C. feriata was 16%, whereas the genetic distance between P. pelagicus and C. feriata to the outgroup was 20%. The molecular method is crucial for species identification and population stock assessment. This information helps in determining stock boundaries, estimating population sizes, and understanding the genetic health of populations. Genetic data will help the government to have a better management of the fisheries activities in Indonesia by providing the diversity and population data.},

   abstract = {Tracking changes in community composition in the coral reef ecosystem is essential, mainly to understand the complexities of the ecosystem and its long-term response to environmental and anthropogenic threats. A standardized method sensitive to changes and comparable across sites is needed to provide robust data helpfully. We used a standardized monitoring protocol Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structure (ARMS), to investigate the growth of marine sessile communities and observe variations in motile taxa (decapods) composition through time. Eighteen units of ARMS were deployed at a depth of ∼10–15 m in the coral reef ecosystem in Pemuteran, Bali, Indonesia; three units were then recovered every two months for one year. The sessile community in each ARMS plate was then photographed and annotated using a web-based annotation tool called CoralNet, while the motile decapods were identified using their morphological characteristics. We observed twenty-four benthic categories of sessile communities and three infraorder of decapods across the sampling duration. The sessile community was contributed mainly by Encrusting Sponge, Brown Flesh Algae, and Bryozoan in almost every sampling duration. The ANOVA result shows that the composition is significantly different over time, showing apparent changes in composition. However, the NMDS result indicated similar structure composition during the ARMS's time retrieval. Future research on temporal changes in benthic diversity can be used to understand the dynamic more about relationship between motile and sessile and how their interaction can affect the coral reef community.},

The main constituents of coral reef ecosystems are coral animals that belong to the Anthozoa class. Sepulu waters (Madura Island), Bangkalan District, East Java Province, Indonesia, has a percentage of coral cover that is in the bad category, management of coral reefs in this area has not been the main focus and it is feared that the situation will get worse so efforts are needed to maintain coral reefs to be sustainable and better. This management effort requires an analysis of species identification. DNA barcoding of corals has never been done on corals of Sepulu waters. The purpose of this study is to find out the DNA of barcoding coral species on Sepulu waters. Genetic marker Cytochrome Oxidase I of the mitochondrial genome DNA (mtDNA) was used to analyze genetic diversity. Reconstruction of phylogenetic tree and genetic diversity were done by using software MEGA X. Research results showed that sample DBP011101 closely related to Dipsatraea maxima 99.55%, DBP011102 closely related to Porites rus 99.4%, DBP011103 closely related to Acropora hyacinthus 99.11%, DBP011104 closely related to Porites cf lichen 98.66%, DBP011106 closely related to Dipsastraea rotumana 95.37%, DBP011107 closely related to Porites horrisoni 98.81%, and DBP011108 closely related to Acropora valida 98.38%.

   abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is an increasingly popular technique to investigate biodiversity; however, many methodological unknowns remain, especially concerning the biases resulting from marker choice. Regions of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 18S rDNA (18S) genes are commonly employed “universal” markers for eukaryotes, but the extent of taxonomic biases introduced by these markers and how such biases may impact metabarcoding performance is not well quantified. Here, focusing on macroeukaryotes, we use standardized sampling from autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) deployed in the world's most biodiverse marine ecosystem, the Coral Triangle, to compare the performance of COI and 18S markers. We then compared metabarcoding data to image-based annotations of ARMS plates. Although both markers provided similar estimates of taxonomic richness and total sequence reads, marker choice skewed estimates of eukaryotic diversity. The COI marker recovered relative abundances of the dominant sessile phyla consistent with image annotations. Both COI and the image annotations provided higher relative abundance estimates of Bryozoa and Porifera and lower estimates of Chordata as compared to 18S, but 18S recovered 25% more phyla than COI. Thus, while COI more reliably reflects the occurrence of dominant sessile phyla, 18S provides a more holistic representation of overall taxonomic diversity. Ideal marker choice is, therefore, contingent on study system and research question, especially in relation to desired taxonomic resolution, and a multimarker approach provides the greatest application across a broad range of research objectives. As metabarcoding becomes an essential tool to monitor biodiversity in our changing world, it is critical to evaluate biases associated with marker choice.},

One example of this cryptic biodiversity is the high abundance of decapods in dead coral heads that associated with various biota. However, this diversity poorly studied especially species identification and species richness. This study aims to estimate the decapods diversity in Raja Ampat, Papua, using Pocillopora dead coral head method as semi-quantitative sampling approach. Raja Ampat in Papua is chosen because it situated in the center of Coral Triangle marine hotspot. Data were collected from 10 dead coral heads of genus Pocillopora from 10-meter depth near the islands of Kri and Misool. This study observed a total of 205 individuals Decapoda from Kri Island and 672 Individual from Misool Islands. Species richness observation (Chao1 and ACE) of the total samples reports only 11 families of decapoda detected in this study. Rarefaction curve reach an asymptote after all after all ten dead coral were analyzed; indicating that additional sample collection would not change estimates of diversity found in this study. The Shannon-Wiener index diversity on the Kri Island showed lower diversity value (2.09) compared to Misool Island (2.18). In the future, this research can be used as a basis for understanding the diversity of coral reefs as well as for management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems.},

Forty-three samples of zooplankton were collected every 4 km according to the range time and station of aqua MODIS. Generalized additive model (GAM) we used to modelling zooplankton biomass response from environmental properties.Thirty one samples were used to build a model of inverse distance weighting (IDW) (cell size 0.01) and 12 samples were used as a control to verify the models accuracy. Furthermore, Getis-Ord Gi was used to identify the significance of the hotspot and cold-spot for foraging area. The GAM models was explain 88.1% response of zooplankton biomass and percent to full moon, phytopankton biomassbeing strong predictors. The sampling design was essential in order to build highly accurate models. Our models 96% accurate for phytoplankton and 88% accurate for zooplankton. The foraging behaviour was significantly related to plankton biomass hotspots, which were two times higher compared to plankton cold-spots. In addition, extremely steep slopes of the Lamakera strait support strong upwelling with highly productive waters that affect the presence of marine megafauna. This study detects that the Lamakera strait provides the planktonic requirements for marine megafauna foraging, helping to explain why this region supports such high diversity and abundance of marine megafauna.},

Three cultivars of Bali local rice namely "Mansur A", "Merah Cendana" and "Putih Cempaka" were used in this study. Seedlings were grown hydroponically and leaves were harvested for DNA extraction at two weeks after transfer to a hydroponic system. PCR reactions were carried out using DREB and SOD specific primers. Agarose electrophoresis revealed a DREB fragment of 1020 bp. Sequence alignment showed identical DREB sequences between the three Bali rice cultivars. A neighbor-joining analysis of other DREB sequences showed that sequences from the Bali rice cultivars tested were very closely related to DREB1 of Oryza sativa Indica Group. PCR of SOD gene of the three Bali rice cultivars showed 970 bp fragments in agarose gel.

PCR-RFLP analysis and nucleotide sequence analysis for the mtDNA COI region was performed on these samples. HincII and AseI restriction assay discriminated M. lusoria, M. petechialis, and Taiwanese Meretrix, corresponding to the relatively large nucleotide substitution (6.35-8.20 %). In Taiwan, M. lusoria was introduced from Japan in the 1920s; however, our results suggest that Taiwanese Meretrix is genetically differentiated from M. lusoria. As well, the exotic Taiwanese Meretrix was found from Nishinagisa on the north coast of Tokyo Bay, demonstrating the Taiwanese Meretrix now occurs with M. lusoria in its native habitat. Meretrix seedlings (Kumamoto origin) from a Taiwanese aquaculture facility has been released into Nishinagisa since 2008 suggesting the Taiwanese Meretrix is inadvertently mixed with the M. lusoria produced in the aquaculture facility. In contrast, all samples from Kisarazu, on the east coast of Tokyo Bay, were identified as M. lusoria despite there being mass releases of M. lusoria (Kumamoto origin) cultured in Taiwan since 2007. Quality control procedures are needed for future Meretrix spp. releases to prevent further spread of the Taiwanese Meretrix. © 2013 The Author(s).},

RFLP analysis using two endonucleases (AluI and TaqI) enabled discrimination of all species, including the P. longipes complex. The diagnostic DNA markers, supplemented with nucleotide sequence analysis, were applied to 44 mid- to late-stage phyllosoma larvae (7.4 to 27.7 mm in body length) collected in the northwestern Pacific. These samples were unexpectedly variable in species composition, comprising P. japonicus (n = 16), P. longipes bispinosus (21), P. longipes longipes (1), P. "aka" (1), and P. penicillatus (5). Comparison of larval size at similar stages revealed that P. l. bispinosus larvae were significantly larger than P. japonicus. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

   abstract = {Studies on horseshoe crabs morphometrics found that they have maintained their descendent features from the Late Ordovician Period to present day. In the present study, we applied the allometric study to evaluate the correlation of body growth in three populations of the Asian horseshoe crab (Tachypleus gigas) collected from Balok (Pahang), Cherok Paloh (Pahang) and Merlimau (Melaka), Malaysia, coastal areas. The aims of this study are to examine the logarithmic growth of horseshoe crabs between three populations by analyzing the variation of their body weight (BW), carapace length (CL), carapace width (CW) and telson length (TEL) to determine their growth and maturity. Their body parameters were analyzed by the allometric method. There are no significant differences between males weight in all populations (p>0.05). However, females from Merlimau were smallest (BW: 519.7±66.3 g; CL: 21.1±1.1 cm; CW: 19.6±0.9 cm) among the three populations; Balok (BW: 928.5±123.2 g; CL: 23.8±1.0 cm; CW: 23.3±1.0 cm) and Cherok Paloh (BW: 939.8±125.7 g; CL: 25.4±1.5 cm; CW: 25.1±1.6 cm). Males and females of T. gigas in Merlimau could be classified as less matured among Balok and Cherok Paloh, since the increment of CL/CW were higher than their BW. Further study on T. gigas allometry along Malaysian coastal area is needed to understand the variation growth between populations. The study could be an alarming condition to a particular T. gigas population.},

With the exception of a few reports regarding the morphological features of T. tridentatus, a three-dimensional analysis of its inner anatomical structures has never been documented. Here, the anatomical structures in two T. tridentatus specimens were examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the larger of the two specimens, the three-dimensional T2-weighted image clearly revealed muscles, digestive and urinary systems, ovary, and brain; however, the cardiovascular system was poorly visualized. In the smaller specimen, cardiovascular, digestive, and urinary systems were identifiable. In the three-dimensional T1-weighted images, tissue contrast was low, making it challenging to distinguish the individual organs. These results suggest that MRI is a powerful tool for visualizing the inner anatomical structures of horseshoe crabs.},

We sequenced the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDN A), which included the partial ends of the 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes, 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene, and two internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) for 15 populations of the 14 species. We analyzed the recognition sites of four restriction endonucleases, which had been proposed for discrimination of Japanese Tetranychus species, and constructed a scheme for Tetranychus species identification by PCR-restriction fragment-length polymorphism. We then applied the scheme to 245 individuals from 199 populations, most of them were from foreign countries. As a result, all 14 species were correctly identified using PCR-restriction fragment-length polymorphism.

   abstract = {Trogoderma granarium Everts, the khapra beetle, native to the Indian subcontinent, is one of the world’s most destructive pests of stored food products. Early detection of this pest facilitates prompt response towards the invasion and prevents the need for costly eradication efforts. Such detection requires proper identification of T. granarium, which morphologically resembles some more frequently encountered, non-quarantine congeners. All life stages of these species are difficult to distinguish using morphological characters. Additionally, biosurveillance trapping can result in the capture of large numbers of specimens awaiting identification. To address these issues, we aim to develop an array of molecular tools to rapidly and accurately identify T. granarium among non-target species. Our crude, cheap DNA extraction method performed well for Trogoderma spp. and is suitable for downstream analyses including sequencing and real-time PCR (qPCR). We developed a simple quick assay usingrestriction fragment length polymorphism to distinguish between T. granarium and the closely related, congeneric T. variabile Ballion and T. inclusum LeConte. Based on newly generated and published mitochondrial sequence data, we developed a new multiplex TaqMan qPCR assay for T. granarium with improved efficiency and sensitivity over existing qPCR assays. These new tools benefit regulatory agencies and the stored food products industry by providing cost- and time-effective solutions to enhance the identification of T. granarium from related species. They can be added to the existing pest detection toolbox. The selection of which method to use would depend on the intended application.},

The rapid detection and differentiation between more and less harmful Frankliniella species is, therefore, important in order to combat the pests at the time of their appearance. In this study, we have undertaken to develop a method of detecting F. occidentalis, F. intonsa, F. pallida, and F. tenuicornis. The protocol is based on PCR amplification of ITS1 rDNA fragments of these insects using universal primers pair giving products of slightly distinct length for studied insects. Restriction enzymes digestion which is easy to interpret, allows for visible differentiation of all these Frankliniella species. The method was shown to be species-specific and sensitive.

   abstract = {While there are persistent calls for developing more marine protected areas (MPAs) for Asian horseshoe crab conservation in response to population declines in Asia–Pacific region, most existing horseshoe crab MPAs were designated without prior comprehensive population assessment and habitat characterization. This study collected biological and habitat information in Hong Kong, in order to identify priority sites for conservation and management of Asian horseshoe crab populations. The territory-wide surveys at 18 spawning/nursery beaches displayed a persistently low mean juvenile density from 0.16 to 2.19 ind/100 m2 in 2012 and 0.08 to 1.41 ind/100 m2 in 2014. These density data were within the same range of that in 2002 and 2007 (0.10–1.97 ind/100 m2), apart from a low survey return of 0.08–0.31 ind/100 m2 in 2004. The current population of juvenile T. tridentatus and C. rotundicauda in Hong Kong is estimated about 2100–4300 and 2400–3000 individuals, respectively. From the 2012–2014 data, no new recruitments of 1st–3rd instar juveniles were found, as the shores were occupied mostly by 6th–9th instar juveniles of prosomal width between 23 and 45 mm, in which considerably high mortality rates were noted. The present findings of existing small and discrete juvenile populations, coupled with relatively few recruits, suggest that the status of juvenile horseshoe crabs in Hong Kong is fragile and vulnerable to local extirpation, especially if no urgent protection measures are implemented. Based on available population data and habitat characteristics, three MPAs, ranging from 5 to 7 km2, are proposed, so as to conserve over 60 and 70 % of the existing juvenile populations of T. tridentatus and C. rotundicauda, respectively. The approach adopted in this study may serve as a case study for proposing other horseshoe crab MPAs in Asia, where increasing human disturbances and over-harvest are imminent.},

We examined the abundance and distribution of juveniles of 2 species of horseshoe crabs, Tachypleus tridentatus and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, in a mangrove-vegetated estuary (Pearl Bay, Guangxi, China). Intertidal sampling and measurement of environmental variables were carried out in October 2014 at 4 sites spanning ~6.3 km from the inner to the outer bay. Both species were found at the 2 innermost mangrove sites but not at the outer 2 sites. Densities were higher than recorded in previous studies, 0.24 ind. m-2 for C. rotundicauda and 0.05 ind. m-2 for T. tridentatus. Although only 12 of the latter species were found, they appeared to be more abundant in more seaward, energetic environments in poorly sorted sediments, whereas C. rotundicauda occurred in sediments with higher silt-clay and organic carbon content, and aggregated at the mangrove forest edges. These small-scale distribution differences are consonant with the species’ life histories, since only T. tridentatus migrates to the sea while C. rotundicaudata spends its entire life within or near mangrove habitats. International and national conservation strategies for these species should include further efforts to inventory critical habitats, such as Pearl Bay, in southeast Asia.},

Yet, there are no studies on the juvenile of Asian horseshoe crab in Indonesia. As the first report on the juvenile of Asian horseshoe crabs in Indonesia, this study aims to analyze the population density of the juvenile Asian horseshoe crab and the characteristics of nursery habitats in Teritip Beach, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The discovery of the juvenile of three species (Carcinoscorpious rotundicauda, Tachypleus tridentatus, and T. gigas) was consistent and supporting the existence of adult individuals. Their population density was mainly dominated by C. rotundicauda (1.56–12.50 Ind./100 m2), followed by T. gigas (1.56–3.13 Ind./100 m2) and T. tridentatus (1.56–3.13 Ind./100 m2). The distribution pattern of C. rotundicauda showed that the juveniles were near the mangrove habitat during August–September and relatively seaward during October. Meanwhile, T. gigas and T. tridentatus exhibited a shift in the distribution pattern from September to October. The above results were supported by the most influential habitat parameter, particularly for silt content from the sediment. Based on the population density and habitat characteristics, 0.4 km2 of the intertidal zone was identified as a nursery/spawning ground. These findings are essential drivers for future marine protected areas (MPAs) proposals for horseshoe crabs.},

Based on Kruskal-Wallis tests, the result showed a significant difference in somebody measurements (TL and CL) between males and females. The principal component analysis (PCA) results showed that all morphometric characters had a strong correlation in both sexes, so the first principal component (PC1) values were 92% and 72%. In comparison, the second principal component (PC2) values were 5% and 20% in females and males, respectively. The results of discriminant function analysis (DFA) suggested that only one (BW) of the five morphometric characters was significant in separating both sexes. Both sexes were also revealed variations in growth patterns based on the allometric analysis results.

   abstract = {There is limited study on DNA barcoding of horseshoe crabs in South Sumatra, Indonesia. The present study was the first to record horseshoe crabs' COI DNA barcoding in three localities of Banyasin estuarine waters. The nucleotide composition was in a strong adenine thymine bias (AT = 63.90%) with high haplotypic diversity (Hd = 0.858) relative to low nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0534). A total of 16 haplotypes were recorded, of which two were in Carat Cape, 4 in Makati Jaya, and 12 in the Banyuasin river estuary (BRE), and Hap 1 was a dominant type (62.5%). The population differentiation (FST) value was varied, and only in the comparison of BRE-Carat Cape was significant (FST = 0.637), while the gene flow (Nm) value in Makati Jaya-BRE was high (6.563). The neutrality test, Tajima's D (0.4142), and Fu's Fs values were negative (-0.492), suggesting these populations have experienced a current bottleneck or multiplication. Analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) suggested that 68% was distributed within populations. The haplotype network, PCoA, and phylogenetic of COI DNA sequences clustered in three groups correspond to Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, Tachypleus gigas, and Tachypleus tridentatus. This finding is a matter of concern for managing and conserving horseshoe crab species in Banyuasin estuarine waters.},

   abstract = {Species with limited dispersal abilities are often composed of highly genetically structured populations across small geographic ranges. This study aimed to investigate the haplotype diversity and genetic connectivity of the coastal horseshoe crab (Tachypleus gigas) in Indonesia. To achieve this, we collected a total of 91 samples from six main T. gigas habitats: Bintan, Balikpapan, Demak, Madura, Subang, and Ujung Kulon. The samples were amplified using primers for mitochondrial (mt) AT-rich region DNA sequences. The results showed 34 haplotypes, including seven shared and 22 unique haplotypes, across all localities. The pairwise genetic differentiation (FST) values were low (0 to 0.13) and not significantly different (p > 0.05), except among samples from Ujung Kulon-Madura and Kulon-Subang (p < 0.05). Additionally, the 34 analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed the most variation within populations (95.23%) compared to less among populations (4.77%). The haplotype network showed evidence of shared haplotypes between populations. Tajima’s D and Fu’s FS test values indicated a population expansion. Our results showed a low level of differentiation, suggesting a single stock and high connectivity. Therefore, a regionally-based conservation strategy is recommended for the coastal horseshoe crab in Indonesia.},

IUCN conservation status of Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda and Tachypleus gigas is still Data Deficient, and in Indonesia research on genetic population is lacking, if any. This study aims to reveal genetic diversity of C. rotundicauda and T. gigas populations in Demak, Madura, and Balikpapan coastal waters. This research was conducted by using molecular analysis with genetic markers Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The primers used in this study were OPB 06, OPG 10, and OPX 03. The results showed that the highest polymorphism of C. rotundicauda was found in Demak (74.6667%) and heterozygosity was 0.2669. Furthermore, T. gigas had the highest polymorphism in Madura (74.3590%) and heterozygosity was 0.25551. Based on pairwise comparison tests, populations of C. rotundicauda and T. gigas in Demak, Madura, and Balikpapan were significantly different (p<0.05). The difference is believed due to the limitation movement of horseshoe crabs from and into the three locations, as well as the presence of natural geographic barrier. Thus,it can be concluded that horseshoe crabs in northern Java and Balikpapan waters has different genetic diversity. Genetically, horseshoe crab in northern Java or Balikpapan had relatively moderate diversity and low adaptation capability.},

   abstract = {Conservation of horseshoe crabs has recently received increasing attention as several populations are in decline. However, scarce information on their distributions in Southeast Asia is impairing conservation efforts. In this study, we sought to improve our understanding of the geographical range and distinct populations of the three Asian horseshoe crabs species in order to identify optimal conservation areas. We mapped the geographic range of Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, Tachypleus gigas, and T. tridentatus using recent data from field work, literature, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and unpublished data from our scientific network. The data were correlated with 23 different environmental variables of potential ecological importance for horseshoe crabs using the openModeller webservices, including new tidal variables. Ecological niche models were generated using two algorithms, Maximum Entropy and support vector machine, for the three species under present conditions, and projected into a climate change scenario of 2050. The niches of the Asian horseshoe crabs were mostly determined by tidal regime, chlorophyll A concentrations, depth, distance to land, and sea surface temperature. According to our predictions, horseshoe crabs in Southeast Asia are not expected to experience any severe change in extent and distribution of suitable habitat in the future. In order to conserve Asian horseshoe crabs, we suggest establishing Marine Protected Areas at locations where distinct populations and several species occur, such as northern Vietnam, China, Borneo, and southern Japan.},

   abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the state of knowledge of mangrove vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact on mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainty over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors on mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Horseshoe crabs Tachypleus gigas and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda are distributed along the northeast coast of India extending from the extreme north of West Bengal through Orissa to the northern coast of Andhra Pradesh. High congregations of these animals are found along the breeding beaches of Orissa and West Bengal during full moon and new moon high tides. Both of these Indian species have significantly different breeding patterns particularly in relation to their habitat and laying of eggs. Although at times both the species inhabit the same body of water, C. rotundicauda selects mudflats of mangroves and T. gigas have the priority for sandy estuarine and creek zones for spawning. Environmental conditions of horseshoe crabs along the Indian coast still remain free from any kind of pollution. Also there is no known commercial exploitation for the production of amebocyte lysate or bait. But the degradation and destruction of breeding beaches by excess human activities have been posing a serious threat. This is in turn affecting the breeding migration of adult pairs (in amplexus) to come ashore for breeding. Over time, it has been observed that the number of nests (identified by their concave shapes) following the high tide has been decreasing, indicating a decline in the number of breeding pairs on the beaches. By taking the example of the status of T. tridentatus in Japan, a concerted effort should be made both at the national and international levels to protect the breeding beaches of horseshoe crabs of the world and allow these precious guests to use the space as an incubator for their fertilized eggs as ever before to grow up to trilobites and swim freely to their nourishing grounds. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

   abstract = {Identification, protection and restoration of spawning habitats are vital for protecting the depleted species. Asian horseshoe crabs are ecologically important macroinvertebrates in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. However, their spawning habitat studies were limited to several reports in tropical regions, possibly due to the lack of modified survey methods, particularly in habitats with a lower density of spawning adults, and/or intermingled with anthropogenic structures. In this study, the year-round egg distribution and spawning habitat baselines of Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda and Tachypleus tridentatus were determined in the northern Beibu Gulf, China. Our findings demonstrated that the peak spawning occurred in June–July and ceased in November–January when the average water temperature dropped below 20 °C. Egg aggregations were found < 10 cm beneath the sediment surface with regular tidal inundation, regardless of seasonal changes, in the vicinity of natural and artificial structures with elevated, mildly sloping substratum within the high tide zones. The nests were characterized by medium-sized sediment grains (0.5–0.9 mm), high temperatures (31–34°C), low water contents (0.8%–0.9%), and total organic carbon contents (0.5%–0.7%), which might maximize the hatching success. The identified nesting beaches were close to nursery habitats for juveniles, and tidal creeks were present as the possible corridor connecting these two important habitats through the dominant mangrove forests. The findings provide valuable insights in the scope of spawning behavior and nest-site selection of Asian horseshoe crabs under a mixture of natural and artificial structures, which could benefit future management efforts for the exploited spawning populations.},

They were kept in the laboratory and fed a mixture of squid, prawn and fish. Prosomal width and wet weight were measured weekly to obtain growth data. Over half of the individuals molted during a five and a half month captivity period. After every ecdysis, prosomal width and wet weight of T. tridentatus grew by averages of 24.2% and 71.5% over pre-molt measurements, respectively. Similar values were obtained for C. rotundicauda, i.e. 24.0% and 77.3%, respectively. Three T. tridentatus with prosomal widths of between 26.5 and 35.0 mm molted twice between 89 and 149 days, leading to an average growth rate of 0.1 mm·day-1 and 0.04 g·day-1 in terms of prosomal width and wet weight, respectively. A positive growth allometry (b coefficient=2.97) was identified, indicating that weight gain for T. tridentatus, and possibly C. rotundicauda, was faster than prosomal width growth after each ecdysis. The effect of temperature on growth was also determined by comparing the percentages of T. tridentatus which molted at ∼28°C and ∼18°C. Fifty percent of individuals molted at the former, but only 10% at the latter. This study indicates that Hong Kong horseshoe crabs take a shorter time to reach sexual maturity, as compared with conspecifics in Japan, because they can molt more frequently at higher sediment/water temperatures (∼28°C) if food is available. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

To avoid the high costs of sampling and monitoring horseshoe crabs, a questionnaire-based survey was designed and administered to local people to collect local knowledge on the population status, distribution, and potential threats that horseshoe crabs face at 35 sites in Indonesia. The results from 237 interviewees showed that horseshoe crabs were observed in 62 districts, including 114 local areas in Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi Island. Approximately 70.5% of interviewees suggested that populations of horseshoe crabs in these districts are declining. The two most cited reasons for the decline included the habit of discarding horseshoe crab bycatch in locations where horseshoe crabs are unable to survive, such as river banks and trash piles (27.7%) and beach litter (19.8%). gillnetting (48.3%) and bottom trawling (42.4%) were the main types of fishing gear responsible for the capture of horseshoe crabs. Due to the common practice of consuming adult crabs in these areas (90.0%), mass harvesting of adult horseshoe crabs was also mentioned by respondents (29.3%). Local knowledge obtained in this study has provided critical information on the distribution, threats, and causes of the decline in horseshoe crab populations. The results of this study therefore suggest that there is an urgent need for a sound management strategy to effectively aid in the conservation of horseshoe crabs.},

We examined potential consumption of amphipods by Dunlins Calidris alpina, Semipalmated Sandpipers C. pusilla, Least Sandpipers C. minutilla and Short-billed Dowitchers Limnodromus griseus during spring migration through Delaware Bay, by amplification of prey DNA fragments in feces with amphipod-specific primers. Our analysis shows that amphipods contributed to the diet of shorebirds and we found significant differences in utilization of these crustaceans among species. Over 80% of Least Sandpipers tested positive for amphipod DNA, implying that these birds may rely heavily on amphipods, and possibly other benthic invertebrates, rather than Horseshoe Crab eggs. A considerable proportion of Semipalmated Sandpipers and Short-billed Dowitchers consumed amphipods as well. Together with previously documented use of tidal mudflats and marshes by shorebirds in Delaware Bay, this may suggest new conservation strategies regarding these habitats.},

The plasma d 15 N crab-egg diet asymptote was enriched ca '4.5 and therefore readily discriminated from that of either blue mussels Mytilus edulis or coquina clams Donax variabilis , the most likely alternative prey of knots in Delaware Bay. Crab eggs were highly palatable to captive knots and turnstones which achieved rates of mass gain (3 Á11 g/d) comparable to that of free-ranging birds. Peak consumption rates during hyperphagic events were 23,940 and 19,360 eggs/bird/d, respectively. The empirical conversions of eggs consumed to body mass gained (5,017 eggs/g for knots and 4,320 eggs/g for turnstones) indicate the large quantities of crab eggs required for the maintenance of these shorebird populations during stopover.},

   abstract = {Context: Investigating the patterns of genetic diversity and population structure of the Javanese ricefish, Oryzias javanicus, is instrumental in identifying their dispersal patterns and demographics in response to ecological changes and biogeographical barriers. Aims: To acquire a better understanding of the evolutionary history of Javanese ricefish. Methods: We sequenced part of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region in 335 individuals and genotyped 280 individuals for four microsatellite loci from seven Indonesian sites. Key results: Both genetic diversity (h = 0.19-0.86 and DIVGene = 0.10-0.43) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0.06-0.61%) were low compared with other fish taxa. The analysis of molecular variance showed considerable genetic differences (P < 0.0001) for both genetic markers across all sampled locations. These results suggest that there has been a historical restriction on gene flow. Conclusion: The observed population-structure pattern reflects a short pelagic larval development, which is closely linked to a restricted dispersal potential. This ultimately leads to isolation by distance, potentially allowing local adaptation to sites that augment any oceanographic, geographic, or biological barriers to gene flow. Implications: The results presented in this study can be used to create more effective ways to protect the species in question.},

The objectives of this research were to asses the horseshoe crabs morphological characters and to identify based on molecular marker of Cytochrome Oxydase Subunit I (COI) gene. The samples were collected from five locations (Segara Menyan Subang, Ujung Kulon Banten, Tambak Lorok Semarang, Betah Walang Demak, and Kenjeran Surabaya) in October 2014 until June 2015. A total of 27 parameters for 62 individuals were used to determine connectivity and character identifier among populations. Data were tested using non-parametric analysis. While, the 5 individuals from each sites were used for molecular analysis including several stages of the DNA extraction, DNA electrophoresis, amplification and visualization of DNA fragments, and DNA sequencing. The results obtained based on morphological characters that T. gigas of Surabaya formed a unique group due to its body size (X1-X2 and X4-X16) was larger than the other 5 body parts (X22, X23, X26-X28) of Semarang, Demak, Subang, and Banten. According to molecular results, there were 650 bp conserve nucleotide sequences. Analysis using software MEGA 5.0 showed that there were 73 existence of specific nucleotide sites that can be used to distinguishes between T. gigas in-groups and out-groups (T. gigas from Central Arabian Sea, T. tridentatus from Sweden, and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda from USA).},

Similarly, we conclude from the presumptive numbers of growth stages that T. tridentatus males generally molt 15 times to reach maturity in the thirteenth year; females molt 16 times to reach maturity in the fourteenth year. Although we have few data on growth stages of Tachypleus gigas and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, it is thought that T. gigas males molt 12 times to reach adulthood, females molt 13 times, and that C. rotundicauda reaches matu- rity after the thirteenth molt in both males and females},

DNA sequence analysis of 369 base pairs (bp) of the mt AT-rich region revealed 10 haplotypes among the 47 individuals, with a mean haplotypic diversity (h) of 0.626±0.075 and nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.0039±0.00055. Pairwise F-statistics (FST) revealed significantly high gene flow between Kinmen and Dongwei (FST=-0.0351 , p>0.05, Nem=∞), but marked population subdivision and restricted gene flow between Kinmen and Tiexianwei (FST=0.1382, p<0.05, Nem=3.1176). Between populations at Magong Island, gene flow was moderate (FST=0.0634, p>0.05, Nem=7.3913). Mismatch distribution analysis indicated that the relatively low haplotype and nucleotide diversity observed in the Tiexianwei T. tridentatus population can be attributed to a recent bottleneck, probably due to isolation of Tiexianwei in semi-closed Magong Bay that prevents gene flow from neighboring populations. © 2007 Zoological Society of Japan.},

The generated cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) sequences of T. gigas were compared with the GenBank sequences of five populations from Bangladesh, Thailand, Singapore, South China, and Malaysia. A total of 33 unique haplotypes were observed in six populations of T. gigas.

It indicated that the Indian and Bangladesh populations were genetically close and distinct from the other four populations. Furthermore, the migrant per generation (Nm) was 0.16, which indicated a low gene flow among T. gigas populations. The haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (π) were 0.7482 and 0.00313, respectively.

The actual position of such a genetic break along Peninsular Malaysia as well as the connectivity status of the southernmost C. rotundicauda populations with east and west coast populations remain unexplored, however. The aim was to investigate the genetic diversity and structure of C. rotundicauda populations from the west (Kuala Sepetang in State Perak), east (Balok in State Pahang), and southern (Pendas in State Johor) coasts of Peninsular Malaysia. Haemolymph samples from adult C. rotundicauda specimens (n = 152) and eggs from their freshly deposited nests (n = 190) were collected monthly (from January 2016 to January 2017) for the sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Gene isolates of C. rotundicauda from the present study were compared with National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank sequences to cover most of the range of the species in Asia. A neighbour-joining tree strongly supported two clades, separating the west-coast populations from the south- and east-coast populations, with further substructure patterns. Both haplotype network and barrier analyses revealed a genetic break within the Strait of Malacca instead of the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia. The southernmost samples from the Strait of Johor formed a haplotypic diverse gene pool that appeared only as a subclade of the eastern populations. In a detailed haplotype network of 347 individuals, individuals with similar COI sequences indicate connectivity between C. rotundicauda on the east and C. rotundicauda on south and south west of Peninsular Malaysia. Overall, the genetic break between C. rotundicauda populations is better explained by the convergent ocean currents and available mangrove habitats on the west coast (i.e. Strait of Malacca), rather than the point of the Malay Peninsula acting as a land barrier alone.},

A total of 16 haplotypes were recorded, of which two were in Carat Cape, 4 in Makati Jaya, and 12 in the Banyuasin river estuary (BRE), and Hap 1 was a dominant type (62.5%). The population differentiation (FST) value was varied, and only in the comparison of BRE-Carat Cape was significant (FST = 0.637), while the gene flow (Nm) value in Makati Jaya-BRE was high (6.563). The neutrality test, Tajima's D (0.4142), and Fu's Fs values were negative (-0.492), suggesting these populations have experienced a current bottleneck or multiplication. Analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) suggested that 68% was distributed within populations. The haplotype network, PCoA, and phylogenetic of COI DNA sequences clustered in three groups correspond to Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, Tachypleus gigas, and Tachypleus tridentatus.

The genome contains five Hox clusters with 34 Hox genes, the highest number reported in any invertebrate. Detailed analysis of the genome provides evidence that suggests three rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD), raising questions about the relationship between WGD and species radiation. Several gene families, particularly those involved in innate immunity, have undergone extensive tandem duplication.

Nonetheless, analysis of molecular variance revealed significant genetic differentiation, FST = 0.0203 (p <.005 after Bonferroni corrections). Furthermore, both Pairwise fixation index values showed significance among majority population sites, indicating that dispersal potential and gene flow were low in the past. This pattern likely reflects a low dispersal potential, potentially allowing local adaptation to sites that augment any oceanographic and geographic contribution to genetic structure.

   abstract = {The mangrove forests of Southeast Asia are highly biodiverse and provide multiple ecosystem services upon which millions of people depend. Mangroves enhance fisheries and coastal protection, and store among the highest densities of carbon of any ecosystem globally. Mangrove forests have experienced extensive deforestation owing to global demand for commodities, and previous studies have identified the expansion of aquaculture as largely responsible. The proportional conversion of mangroves to different land use types has not been systematically quantified across Southeast Asia, however, particularly in recent years. In this study we apply a combined geographic information system and remote sensing method to quantify the key proximate drivers (i.e., replacement land uses) of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2012. Mangrove forests were lost at an average rate of 0.18% per year, which is lower than previously published estimates. In total, more than 100,000 ha of mangroves were removed during the study period, with aquaculture accounting for 30% of this total forest change. The rapid expansion of rice agriculture in Myanmar, and the sustained conversion of mangroves to oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, are identified as additional increasing and under-recognized threats to mangrove ecosystems. Our study highlights frontiers of mangrove deforestation in the border states of Myanmar, on Borneo, and in Indonesian Papua. To implement policies that conserve mangrove forests across Southeast Asia, it is essential to consider the national and subnational variation in the land uses that follow deforestation.},

   abstract = {Horseshoe crabs are marine arthropods that are amongst the oldest living creatures that still exist today. Among the four extant species of horseshoe crabs, Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda differs from the other species by having poisonous eggs and lays its eggs in sandy-mud areas near river mouths. With the rapid development of coastal areas worldwide, C. rotundicauda habitats are decreasing. Until now, however, there has not been any study on the species' genetic variation. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were employed to study the genetic variation in five C. rotundicauda populations from the east and west coasts of the Malay Peninsula. Both markers showed differing levels of genetic variation, but concurred on the pattern of genetic structuring among populations of the species. This includes showing that little, although significant, genetic differentiation is present among populations, suggesting a low rate of gene flow among populations. The results also suggested that C. rotundicauda may be subjected to the land barrier effect of the Malay Peninsula, whereby gene flow is limited between populations occurring on both sides of the peninsula, increasing their genetic differentiation through time.},

   abstract = {<p>Restriction site variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) was surveyed in populations ranging from New Hampshire to the Gulf Coast of Florida. MtDNA clonal diversity was moderately high, particularly in southern samples, and a major genetic "break" (nucleotide sequence divergence approximately 2%) distinguished all sampled individuals which were north vs. south of a region in northeastern Florida. The area of genotypic divergence in Limulus corresponds to a long-recognized zoogeographic boundary between warm-temperate and tropical marine faunas, and it suggests that selection pressures and/or gene flow barriers associated with water mass differences may also influence the evolution of species widely distributed across such transition zones. On the other hand, a comparison of the mtDNA divergence patterns in Limulus with computer models involving stochastic lineage extinction in species with limited gene flow demonstrates that deterministic explanations need not necessarily be invoked to account for the observations. Experiments to distinguish stochastic from deterministic possibilities are suggested. Overall, the pattern and magnitude of mtDNA differentiation in horseshoe crabs is very similar to that typically reported for freshwater and terrestrial species assayed over a comparable geographic range. Results demonstrate for the first time that, geographically, at least some continuously distributed marine organisms can show considerable mtDNA genetic differentiation.</p>},

For the purpose of the study, dual-core (black and white) two signal system SaveWave® acoustic devices and 2 pieces of multifilament bottom gill nets, each with a length of 1500 m and mesh size of 17 mm, were used. One of the experimental nets is a non-equipped control net and the other was a net bearing acoustic devices (active net). According to the results of the study, catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 0.96±0.10 kg/km.h with active nets whereas it was 0.50±0.06 kg/km.h with control nets (P<0.05). Moreover, the damage occurred on control nets was 69.8% higher than active nets. On the contrary, the biomass of control nets was determined to be 34.4%. Usage of acoustic devices for commercial fishing was demonstrated to bring a profit of 3.30TL/km.s otherwise each fishing boat to make an average loss of 2191.72 TL throughout the season. © Published by Central Fisheries Research Institute (CFRI) Trabzon, Turkey in cooperation with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan.},

   abstract = {<p> The connectivity among marine populations is determined by the dispersal capabilities of adults as well as their eggs and larvae. Dispersal distances and directions have a profound effect on gene flow and genetic differentiation within species. Genetic homogeneity over large areas is a common feature of coral reef fishes and can reflect high dispersal capability resulting in high levels of gene flow. If fish larvae return to their parental reef, gene flow would be restricted and genetic differentiation could occur. <italic>Larabicus quadrilineatus</italic> (Labridae) is considered as an endemic fish species of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The juveniles of this species are cleaner fish that feed on ectoparasites of other fishes. Here, we investigated the genetic population structure and gene flow in <italic>L. quadrilineatus</italic> among five locations in the Red Sea to infer connectivity among them. To estimate genetic diversity, we analysed 369 bp of 237 mitochondrial DNA control region sequences. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were higher in the southern than in the northern Red Sea. Analysis of molecular variance ( <sc>amova</sc> ) detected the highest significant genetic variation between northern and central/southern populations (Φ <sub>CT</sub>  = 0.01; <italic>P</italic>  &lt; 0.001). Migration analysis revealed a several fold higher northward than southward migration, which could be explained by oceanographic conditions and spawning season. Even though the Φ <sub>ST</sub> value of 0.01 is rather low and implies a long larval dispersal distance, estimates based on the isolation‐by‐distance model show a very low mean larval dispersal distance (0.44–5.1 km) compared to other studies. In order to enable a sustainable ornamental fishery on the fourline wrasse, the results of this study suggest that populations in the northern and southern Red Sea should be managed separately as two different stocks. The rather low larval dispersal distance of about 5 km needs to be considered in the design of marine protected areas to enable connectivity and self‐seeding. </p>},

   abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the state of knowledge of mangrove vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact on mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainty over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors on mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Previous genetic studies in the Coral Triangle indicate the presence of multiple limits to connectivity. However, these studies have focused almost exclusively on benthic, reef-dwelling species. Schooling, reef-associated fusiliers (Perciformes: Caesionidae) account for a sizable portion of the annual reef catch in the Coral Triangle, yet to date, there have been no indepth studies on the population structure of fusiliers or other mid-water, reef-associated planktivores across this region. We evaluated the genetic population structure of C. cuning using a 382 bp segment of the mitochondrial control region amplified from over 620 fish sampled from 33 localities across the Philippines and Indonesia. Phylogeographic analysis showed that individuals sampled from sites in western Sumatra belong to a distinct Indian Ocean lineage, resulting in pronounced regional structure between western Sumatra and the rest of the Coral Triangle (φCT = 0.4796, p < 0.004). We found additional significant population structure between central Southeast Asia and eastern Indonesia (φCT = 0.0450, p < 0.001). These data in conjunction with spatial analyses indicate that there are 2 major lineages of C. cuning and at least 3 distinct management units across the region.

Aims To acquire a better understanding of the evolutionary history of Javanese ricefish. Methods We sequenced part of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region in 335 individuals and genotyped 280 individuals for four microsatellite loci from seven Indonesian sites. Key results Both genetic diversity (h = 0.19–0.86 and DIVGene = 0.10–0.43) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0.06–0.61%) were low compared with other fish taxa. The analysis of molecular variance showed considerable genetic differences (P &lt; 0.0001) for both genetic markers across all sampled locations. These results suggest that there has been a historical restriction on gene flow. Conclusion The observed population-structure pattern reflects a short pelagic larval development, which is closely linked to a restricted dispersal potential. This ultimately leads to isolation by distance, potentially allowing local adaptation to sites that augment any oceanographic, geographic, or biological barriers to gene flow. Implications The results presented in this study can be used to create more effective ways to protect the species in question.</p>},

Bayesian clustering methods over all sampling locations revealed evidence of two genetically distinct clusters, one located predominantly on the shallow Sunda Shelf and the second in the deep waters associated with the biogeographic region known as Wallacea; further analysis revealed additional genetic structure around the island of Halmahera and the Islands of Nias and Mentawai. We propose that the observed genetic differentiation is the result of habitat loss during periods of glacial maxima and differences in physical oceanographic properties throughout the Archipelago. The subsequent recolonization of this habitat as glaciers retreat and sea levels return to present‐day levels creates an unparalleled opportunity for colonists to exploit new habitat. The documentation of cryptic diversity will aid in the identification of hot spots of biodiversity and ultimately its conservation.

Yet, despite indications that the IAA may harbour greater intraspecific variation, multiple‐locus genetic diversity data are limited. We investigated microsatellite DNA variation in <italic>Pinctada maxima</italic> populations from the IAA to elucidate potential factors influencing levels of genetic diversity in the region. Results indicate that genetic diversity decreases as the geographical distance away from central Indonesia increases, and that populations located towards the centre of <italic>P. maxima</italic> 's range are more genetically diverse than those located peripherally ( <italic>P &lt;</italic>  0.01).

We propose that the genetic diversity peak in <italic>P. maxima</italic> populations may be due to (i) an abundance of suitable habitat within the IAA, meaning larger, more temporally stable populations can be maintained and are less likely to encounter genetic bottlenecks; and/or (ii) the close proximity of biogeographical barriers around central Indonesia results in increased genetic diversity in the region because of admixture of genetically divergent populations. We encourage further genetic diversity studies of IAA marine biota to confirm whether this region has a significant role in maintaining intraspecific diversity, which will greatly assist the planning and efficacy of future conservation efforts. </p>},

Genetic diversity and population structure of the boring giant clam (Tridacna crocea) in Kei Islands, Maluku, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 1273-1282. Giant clams (Tridacninae) are ecologically important species in the coral reef ecosystems. They provide valuable functionsto traditional fisheries in Kei Islands, Maluku. However, their population isunder great pressure due to anthropogenic threats, such as overfishing and habitat degradation. To provide important data for devising effective conservation management strategies for giant clams, we investigated genetic diversity and population structure of the boring giant clams Tridacna croceain Kei Islands based on partial mitochondrial COI gene sequence. Tissue samples were collected from six sites: Kur, Dullah Laut, Tanimbar Kei, Dar, Labetawi, and Difur. We sequenced 477 base pairs of COI gene and identified 42 haplotypes and 52 polymorphic sites. Analysis of genetic diversity showed Dullah Laut and Dar had the highest genetic diversity. Population structure and genetic distance analysis showed unstructured populations with high genetic closeness among sites. This finding was also confirmed by the mixture pattern of the haplotype network. Further analysis using Bayesian models on gene flow revealed high genetic exchange among sites and that Dullah Population predominantly served as a source site for the other sites. This indicated a high probability of successful larval dispersal among sites. Based on these findings, we predict that the boring giant clams likely form a single population in Kei Islands. Our study warrants conservation priority for Dullah population as the main source of gene flow.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>During spawning events, horseshoe crab eggs are released from the female's oviducts, and fertilized by one or more males. Eggs are shaped by the female into discrete clutches deposited in nests at depths of 10-20 cm on intertidal estuarine beaches. Distinguishing between fresh eggs and the early developmental stages is obfuscated by the large amount of dense, opaque yolk. The first unambiguous confirmation of development is the formation of the rudimentary prosomatic appendages at the "limb bud" stage. Several days thereafter, the outer chorion is shed and the developing embryo expands and undergoes a series of molts within the clear inner egg membrane. The trilobite (first instar) stage thus attained may remain within the beach sediments for several more weeks, until hatching is facilitated by environmental factors such as hydration, agitation, and osmotic shock that accompany the infiltration of seawater into the nests. Trilobites exhibit endogenous circatidal swimming rhythms that are entrained by mechanical agitation, suggesting that peaks in larval swimming are timed to coincide with periods of high water and the inundation of the nests. Larval swimming is limited and does not appear to result in long-distance dispersal. The limited dispersal of the larvae has important implications for the population dynamics of relatively isolated populations. The rate of larval development is highly plastic and is influenced by temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the presence of pollutants. The broad environmental tolerances of horseshoe crab embryos and larvae are important in understanding their current geographic distribution and their evolutionary persistence.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Horseshoe crab populations are declining worldwide, and Tachypleus tridentatus (Leach, 1819) has recently been classified as Endangered in the IUCN Redlist. Among the keys for species survival is successful reproduction. Although there are reports on the reproduction, particularly details on the spawning behaviour, of the American species, Limulus polyphemus (Linnaeus, 1758), information on Southeast Asia species is very scant. This field study reports the nesting activities of T. tridentatus at Jambongan Island, Sabah, Malaysia. Observation were carried out on 16 spawning pairs that were spotted during full and new moon from April-July 2016 in Sabah. Nest placements, number of nests, number of eggs, time spent at each nest, and nest widths, depth, and distance from the highest tide line were recorded for each pair. Tachypleus tridentatus generally laid an average of 967 ± 54.1 eggs/nest (171–2,282) in as many as nine nests on the intertidal zone between 125 and 940 cm from the highest tide. The first nest was dug once the tide began rising, followed by the consecutive nests towards the highest tide line with nest depths ranging between 13 and 22 cm. The complete spawning session (first nest to the last) ended in less than two hours. Time spent in spawning correlates positively with the number of nests and the total number of eggs laid by each spawning female. The spawning area, which is made up mainly by fine and medium-size sediment grains, also experience stable temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen conducive for egg-laying and larval development for successful reproduction. The details of spawning are important for planning successful future conservation initiatives for the species, especially in tropical regions.</p>},

   abstract = {Life-history parameters were used to estimate the dispersal potential of 1021 marine macroinvertebrates recorded in species lists from 91 sites comprising rocky intertidal, subtidal, kelp forest, sandy beach, and soft-bottom habitats in Washington, Oregon, and California. Mean species richness was significantly greater in the California rocky subtidal habitat. Data on development mode, planktonic larval duration, rafting potential, and adult mobility were compiled, and summaries of the dispersal potentials of taxa within each habitat type were generated and compared. In summary, development mode was known or estimated for 76% of species; larval planktonic duration for 49%; adult mobility for 76%; and rafting potential for 46%. In comparisons of species' life-history traits among habitats, sand-dominated habitats were distinct from rocky habitats. In rocky habitats, ∼42% of species had planktonic feeding larvae, 43% had planktonic nonfeeding larvae, and 15% had nonplanktonic larvae. Sandy intertidal habitats had higher proportions of taxa with nondispersing, nonplanktonic larvae and lower proportions of planktonic feeding and non-feeding larvae than all other sites. Soft-bottom subtidal communities had the highest proportion of taxa with planktonic feeding development and larvae with planktonic lifespans >30 d. Species in soft-bottom subtidal sites, therefore, have the greatest potential for extensive larval dispersal, whereas species in soft-bottom intertidal sites have the least potential for larval dispersal. In these sites with limited larval dispersal potential, there is greater potential for adult dispersal through adult movement and rafting. These differences in the dispersal potential of larvae and adults suggest that the effect of environmental changes and the effectiveness of reserves may differ between habitats. Conservation methods, including the use of marine reserves, must therefore be tailored to the habitat of interest if effective protection of community resources is to be achieved.},

   abstract = {<p>Genetic diversity is one of three levels of biological diversity requiring conservation. Genetic theory predicts that levels of genetic variation should increase with effective population size. Soulé (1976) compiled the first convincing evidence that levels of genetic variation in wildlife were related to population size, but this issue remains controversial. The hypothesis that genetic variation is related to population size leads to the following predictions: (1) genetic variation within species should be related to population size; (2) genetic variation within species should be related to island size; (3) genetic variation should be related to population size within taxonomic groups; (4) widespread species should have more genetic variation than restricted species; (5) genetic variation in animals should be negatively correlated with body size; (6) genetic variation should be negatively correlated with rate of chromosome evolution; (7) genetic variation across species should be related to population size; (8) vertebrates should have less genetic variation than invertebrates or plants; (9) island populations should have less genetic variation than mainland populations; and (10) endangered species should have less genetic variation than nonendangered species. Empirical observations support all these hypotheses. There can be no doubt that genetic variation is related to population size, as Soulé proposed. Small population size reduces the evolutionary potential of wildlife species.</p>},

RAPD fingerprints were obtained from DNA samples of 33 individuals in each group. Forty random primers with 10-base oligonucleotides were initially screened and 26 primers yielded amplified products. Two primers, OPC-05 and OPD-20 were selected based on their consistency amplifications. RAPD analysis showed a total of 752 scorable loci were observed. The number of scorable fragments amplified varied from 2 to 18 bands with sizes ranging from 300 to 2000 bp. The RAPD profiles for both populations studied by using OPC-05 primer have generated 329 bands and 423 bands by using OPD-20 primer. The percentages of polymorphic loci were 83.33% and 44.44% for population from Cherating, Pahang and Tanjung Dawai, respectively. The level of gene flow (N m) was (N m = 1.994) which contributed to the population genetic diversity and genetic structure of Malaysian T. gigas. The Nei's gene diversity values were 0.4295 for the population from Cherating, Pahang and 0.3321 for those from Tanjung Dawai. Genetic similarity for intra-population ranged from 0.111 to 0.903 (mean 0.606±0.162) and 0.375 to 0.955 (mean 0.695±0.171) for Cherating and Tanjung Dawai samples, respectively. Based on the unweighted pair group method of arithmetric mean (UPGMA) dendogram, the two populations were separated into two clusters.},

Despite the fundamental importance of environmental history for diversity and conservation, there is little primary evidence concerning the nature of vegetation in north equatorial Southeast Asia during the Last Glacial Period (LGP). As a result, even the general distribution of vegetation during the Last Glacial Maximum is debated. Here we show, using the stable carbon isotope composition of ancient cave guano profiles, that there was a substantial forest contraction during the LGP on both peninsular Malaysia and Palawan, while rainforest was maintained in northern Borneo. These results directly support rainforest “refugia” hypotheses and provide evidence that environmental barriers likely reduced genetic mixing between Borneo and Sumatra flora and fauna. Moreover, it sheds light on possible early human dispersal events.</p>},

Separation among island populations from the Mentawai Archipelago likely dates to the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary approximately 3.5 Ma, and our samples from peninsular Malaysia appear to coalesce in the middle Pleistocene, about 1 Ma.

PCR&#150;RFLP with individual enzymes revealed polymorphism between only some species. However, all the species could be distinguished by using a combination of two enzymes, specifically HaeIII and MspI. PCR&#150;RFLP of 11 to 20 accessions with the same enzyme combination showed no intraspecific variation, which established that the differential banding patterns were species specific. In contrast, the same enzyme combination was not useful for differentiating different species of the genera Cajanus, Rhyncosia, Abies, Rhizophora, Ceriops, and Bruguiera, and it also revealed intraspecies variation in three species of Abies. The present study indicated that digestion of trnS-psbC with two four-base recognizing enzymes reveals more variation than with either enzyme alone and that it may be a method of choice for species identification in some genera.Key words: small millets, PCR&#150;RFLP, trnS-psbC, chloroplast DNA.</p>},

   abstract = {Since the release of the MinION sequencer in 2014, it has been applied to great effect in the remotest and harshest of environments, and even in space. One of the most common applications of MinION is for nanopore-based DNA barcoding in situ for species identification and discovery, yet the existing sample capability is limited (n ≤ 10). Here, we assembled a portable sequencing setup comprising the BentoLab and MinION and developed a workflow capable of processing 32 samples simultaneously. We demonstrated this enhanced capability out at sea, where we collected samples and barcoded them onboard a dive vessel moored off Sisters’ Islands Marine Park, Singapore. In under 9 h, we generated 105 MinION barcodes, of which 19 belonged to fresh metazoans processed immediately after collection. Our setup is thus viable and would greatly fortify existing portable DNA barcoding capabilities. We also tested the performance of the newly released R10.3 nanopore flow cell for DNA barcoding, and showed that the barcodes generated were ~99.9% accurate when compared to Illumina references. A total of 80% of the R10.3 nanopore barcodes also had zero base ambiguities, compared to 50–60% for R9.4.1, suggesting an improved homopolymer resolution and making the use of R10.3 highly recommended.},

Several factors, including anthropogenic pressures, climate change, over-exploitation, and pollution, are known to threaten the brittle star's biodiversity. Therefore, species identification research using molecular methods is essential. Molecular analysis can be conducted using the Cytochrome Oxidase I marker of mitochondrial genome DNA (mtDNA). The sequencing results will be compared with NCBI data to find the closest species. 5 of the total 8 samples were successfully sequenced, identifying three species: Ophiocoma schoenleinii, Breviturma pusilla, Ophiactis savignyi, and Ophiuroidea sp. The comparison of sequencing results with existing NCBI data yielded genetic distances ranging from 0.000 to 0.129. The genetic distance among clades ranged from 0.010 to 0.355. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to examine the relationships between our findings and brittle star data from various countries. We included data from 11 countries: Papua New Guinea, Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Canada, the West Indies, South Africa, South Korea, Brazil, Belgium, and France. Based on the distribution map, the research results are most closely related to data from Papua New Guinea.},

This study illustrated the annual dynamics of ocean currents in Pantar Strait, subsequently assessing the safety rate of commercial diving at those tourism sites in each season. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was generated by the Delft3d flow module to illustrate the annual ocean current dynamic in the Pantar Strait. The safety assessment for marine tourism was classified into 3 levels (safe, alert, and dangerous). Ocean currents exceed maximum velocities in the west season. Various marine tourism sites close to steep slopes were not recommended for commercial diving. They are Munaseli Beach, Obisinga Beach, Pura Diving Spot, and Pasir Putih Beach. These sites experienced an increase in average currents that exceeded the safe threshold each season. Alor Eco Dive Resort was designated as the safest marine tourism, which showed a safe level for either average or maximum ocean currents in each season. Nuhakepa Diving Spot was designated as the second safest marine tourism. Several tourist sites that showed the danger of commercial diving in the west season were Umangdang Beach and Savu Alor. Many tourism sites showed an alert current for commercial diving in Springtide. Therefore, tourists are advised to avoid diving during the spring tide.},

It is widely used for personal consumption and sold in markets. The capture of threadfin bream fish at the Oeba Fish Landing Site and Oesapa Fish Market has been increasing. Continuous high-intensity fishing will likely negatively impact the threadfin bream fish population, leading to stock depletion and reduced catch production. Research on threadfin bream fish in East Nusa Tenggara has yet to be reported, particularly in Kupang Bay and Rote Ndao waters. This study aims to investigate the fisheries biology of threadfin bream fish landed at the Oeba Fish Landing Site and Oesapa Fish Market. A total of 84 threadfin bream fish were sampled from both locations. The length-weight relationship of threadfin bream fish at these sites is negatively allometric with value b < 3, indicating that length growth is more dominant than weight gain. The gonad maturity stages of male and female threadfin bream fish range from GSM I-III. The size distribution of threadfin bream fish ranges from 173-295 mm at the Oeba Fish Landing Site and from 173-245 mm at the Oesapa Fish Market. Most of the threadfin bream found are still in the early stages of gonadal maturity, indicating that these fish are young and not yet ready to spawn. Implementing Sustainable fishing management practices is crucial, including setting catch quotas and minimum catch sizes and educating fishermen to ensure the sustainability of threadfin bream fish stocks.},

   abstract = {Order Xiphosura, or horseshoe crabs, are rarely found and classified as macrofossils. In Indonesian waters, there are three species: Tachypleus tridentatus, Tachypleus gigas, and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda. The genetic analysis of their kinship, however, has been extensively unexplored. This study aims to utilize DNA barcoding, focusing on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) locus from mitochondrial DNA and investigating the phylogenetic relationships of horseshoe crabs from the four sites (Tanjung Jabung Timur Regency in Jambi, Bangka Regency in Bangka Belitung, Demak Regency in Central Java, and Tuban Regency in East Java). Additionally, the study provides insights into the biodiversity and ecological roles of horseshoe crabs within their ecosystems and surrounding habitats. Through molecular methods, this research focuses on biodiversity analysis through Sanger sequencing and MEGA 11 software for constructing phylogenetic trees and calculating genetic distances. With a total of 22 horseshoe crabs, the DNA samples from four different sites were amplified via Sanger sequencing, targeting the COI locus and analyzing with MEGA 11. The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed two distinct species, Tachypleus gigas, and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, exhibiting significant genetic variation between them. A clear genetic separation between the two species was observed. Otherwise, within the C. rotundicauda species, a minor genetic variation was detected between sampling sites. Notably, the genetic composition displayed greater differences between samples from Java and Sumatra compared to differences within each island. The future research should expand the sampling size and include additional genetic markers to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of horseshoe crabs in Indonesian waters. Integrating ecological and environmental data could further elucidate the factors driving genetic differentiation and inform conservation strategies.},

   abstract = {The native Indonesian kampung chicken is a popular and desirable meat source sold live at traditional markets, offering fresh meat for consumers. The aim of this research was to investigate the microbial diversity of intestines and cecum of freshly sacrificed female kampung chickens using genomic sequencing. The DNA from 50 samples of female kampung chickens was extracted and amplified by PCR targeting the 16S rRNA V4 region. The PCR products were sequenced, and the taxonomic composition was summarized using the Phyloseq package, with taxa merged at six levels: domain, phylum, class, family, genus, and species. The result showed that the microbiome was dominated by Firmicutes (61.22%), Bacteroidota (20.06%), Actinobacteriota (7.14%), and Proteobacteria (2.81%). Lactobacillus aviarius (2.82%) was abundant across the samples. The cecum exhibited more diverse microbiomes than the intestines, with a predominance of Firmicutes. Beneficial bacteria, such as L. aviarius (5.26%) and Bacteroides barnesiae (3.03%), were dominant in the small intestine and cecum, respectively. A significant portion of the sequences remained unidentified or uncultured (50.95% and 20.61%, respectively). The gut microbiome of market-sold, freshly sacrificed female kampung chickens displays remarkably high diversity and richness, characterized by beneficial bacterial abundance, crucial for maintaining the chickens' overall health. These findings strongly support the consumer preference for fresh female kampung chicken meat, validating the traditional choice of the local community.},
